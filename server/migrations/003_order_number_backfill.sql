-- Recura — Migration 003: data guards for partially-existing databases
-- Used when the installer detects an existing database that is only partially
-- structured (some tables present). Numbering legacy orders is safe and never
-- touches customer-provided data other than filling the orderNumber column.
-- =============================================================================

-- Backfill sequential order numbers for any order missing one (creation order).
UPDATE "Order" SET "orderNumber" = seq.rn FROM (
  SELECT "id", ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY "createdAt" ASC, "id" ASC) AS rn
  FROM "Order"
